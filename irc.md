### What is IRC?

_From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat)_: Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a form of real-time Internet text messaging (chat) or synchronous conferencing. It is mainly designed for group communication in discussion forums, called channels, but also allows one-to-one communication via private message as well as chat and data transfers via Direct Client-to-Client.

### How do I join the ##catholic channel?

Type in `/join ##catholic` from within any IRC client. Soon you'll be speaking with many others like you, who are interested in spreading the Catholic faith through technology.

### Alternate Ways to Access IRC

There are many ways to join a channel in IRC:

  - Use the web client (either above, or at <https://webchat.freenode.net/>).
  - Use an IRC client for your Mac or PC (a good list of [IRC clients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_clients) on Wikipedia).

### Some Cool IRC Tricks

**Private Messaging**: have something you want to discuss with someone privately, outside the public ##catholic channel? Just type in `/msg username` (replacing `username` with the username of the person you want to talk to).

**Changing Names**: if you'd like to change your username (say, to inform someone you're on the channel, but need to run for a minute), type in `/nick new_username` (example: if you're running to lunch, type in `/nick username_lunch`).

**Directed Messages**: To 'ping' someone inside the channel, simply type in his username and hit enter, or add his username anywhere in your message. Bonus shortcut: just type in the first couple letters of a username and press tab - the program will fill in the rest of the username!
